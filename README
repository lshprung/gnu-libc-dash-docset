Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a GNU C Library (or "glibc") docset for Dash. The script is loosely based on benzado's script for GNU Make https://github.com/benzado/gnu-make-dash-docset.

- GNU C Library: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash
- dash-docset-generation-template: https://github.com/lshprung/dash-docset-generation-template

To generate a docset from the latest edition of the GNU C Library Manual, simply
execute `make` from the same directory as this README file. The latest edition
will be downloaded from https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/libc-html_node.tar.gz and packaged appropriately.

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl
- make
- pup
- sqlite3
